The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.

16/08/24 - mod version 2.0, Updated for v1 of 7 Days to Die

*** FEATURES *** 

*** GENERAL GAMEPLAY ***

Player starts with a new debuff - Despair.
As your despair increases, so your abilities will be negatively affected. If despair reaches 100%, you'll be seconds from death.
Conversely, if you can manage your despair well, you'll receive buffs for remaining positive.
The despair indicator on the HUD will fill as your despair grows, and will change colour to indicate the level of your despair.
If you're able to manage your despair and have a more positive outlook, the icon on the HUD will change, as will the fill colour to indicate your levels of positivity.
Despair can also be checked from the player information screen.

Despair is dynamically affected by various different factors, including:

1. Darkness. Too dark, and your Despair will increase dramatically. Torches, helmet lights and flashlights will mitigate this. Use these in conjunction with a campfire for the best effect.
2. Temperature. If you’re freezing or sweltering, your Despair will also increase dramatically. Find shelter!
3. Environment: Varying degrees of “wetness” will change how Despair affects you, as will your shelter. If you’re warm, dry, sheltered, well lit or resting on a bed or bedroll, AND near an operating campfire,forge or chem station you can effectively “treat” Despair.
4. Hunger and thirst affect how quickly your despair increases. Starvation/dehydration will drastically increase the rate at which you become affected by despair.
5. Injuries will affect how quickly your despair increases.
6. There is medication in trader stock and rare medical loot to treat your despair.
6a. There is also lavender growing wild, which can be collected to make your own lavender seeds, and is also used to make Lavender Oil in a cooking pot at a campfire. Treats 3% Despair.
7. All food has a positive effect. The better the food, the more effective the treatment.
8. Killing zombies and animals will reduce your overall despair. Conversely, getting hit by enemies will increase it.
9. Being in close proximity to zombies increases your Despair. The tougher the zombie, the worse the effect. The effect is compounded, so the more zombies there are, the worse it'll be.
10. Player “wellness”. Your maximum health will also slow down the effects of despair. Every 10 additional health slows down the rate at which Despair affects you.
11. The morale booster from the drone will decrease the rate at which despair affects you.
12. The trader has an effect. Being close to a trader will slow down and/or reduce your Despair.
13. The perk "From the Shadows" also has an effect on the way Despair affects you at NIGHT. The more points in the perk, the less Despair affects you at night.

Headshots! Zombies take maximum damage from headshots, however, they do take small damage if you miss the head.

Zombies DON'T bleed. Nothing undead takes bleed damage.

Hazmat zombies are a guaranteed source of hazmat gear. Kill one, and if it drops loot, it'll have some hazmat gear in there.

There are more zombies in the world. Biomes are gamestaged, which means zombies get tougher and their number increases as you level up.

Nights are dangerous, downtown is much more dangerous.

Traders and vending machines are MUCH more expensive to buy from, and traders will buy from you at a much lower price.

Crafting is 25% more expensive, and loot, harvesting and scrapping quantities are much lower.

XP required to level increased by 25%.

Dismember chance lowered to 1% per attribute level, max at 10%.

Knife base damage rebalanced.


*** AMMO, WEAPONS, MODS AND ARMOUR ***

All arrows and bolts have a 25% chance of causing bleeding on a living target. Shame it doesn't work on the undead …

Ammo can be “dismantled” into its component parts.

The serrated blade only fits on spears and knuckles now.

Hazmat armour mods can be crafted. You’ll still need all four mods (head, gloves, outfit, and boots) for full radiation protection.

New mods - blessed metal for stopping mutated regen. NiCd is back, as is Flaming Oil and Liquid Nitrogen.

New clothing mod - cycling shorts. Install them in your leg armour/clothing and save 25% stamina when cycling.


*** BLOCKS/WORKSTATIONS ***

The beehive. Find bees (and honey) in specific tree stumps (beehives) in the world, and use them to produce honey. Normal wild tree stumps have a higher chance of giving honey too.

The rain collector. Works like a dew collector, but requires an empty bucket to collect water.

The chicken snare. Place this block down, and load it with corn seed to attract and trap chickens, which can be used in coops to produce eggs.
These chickens can also be butchered for meat, feathers and eggs, with a hunting knife in your inventory.

The chicken coop. Place this block, add a chicken from a trap, and it will produce eggs over time. The chicken will "dry out" over time, and will need replacing to keep producing eggs.

The tablesaw cannot be crafted, it can only be collected from POIs. Press "E" to pick one up.

The workbench now has slots for a wrench, hammer, ratchet, impact driver, and nail gun. These tools are needed to craft a lot of items, and some items have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.

The cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.

The forge no longer requires you to smelt items. You can use the items directly from your inventory, and a lot of items are crafted in batches of 5.


*** BUFFS/DEBUFFS ***

Snakes and Spider zombies will envenom you when they attack. Kill snakes to extract their venom, which can be used to make antivenom. Antivenom crafting is unlocked after reading 10 medical magazines, and it can appear in loot and trader stock.

The Wasteland biome is irradiated, and very, VERY dangerous. You'll need hazmat mods before you venture in there.

Radiated zombies now irradiate the player when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.

Some Burnt zombies now set the player on fire when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.

Honey infection treatment reduced to 3% from 5%.

Despair medication (Lavender, St. John’s Wort and Lithium) can be found in medical loot, and in trader stock. Lavender oil can be crafted from lavender flowers and used to treat despair.


*** ZOMBIES/ENEMIES ***

Bears and wolves are back in the forest.

Hazmat zombies are now immune to burning.

New Bunker Buster zombie. Only appears during bloodmoon(s), and can appear from the very first Bloodmoon. You’ll want to take it out quickly … think of it as a “light” demolition zombie.

Demolition zombies appear at a much earlier gamestage.

New Mutated zombie variant. Bigger, tankier, stronger, yellower, and with more radiated regen. You'll need a blessed metal mod to take them down - the wasteland is full of these guys.

New Frozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their “Normal” counterparts. Immune to the effects of liquid nitrogen, and if they touch you, your movement is reduced by 20%. You can negate this by maxing out the Well Insulated perk.  Found in the snow biome.

New Rotting zombie variant. They have lower HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest biome.

New Cowboy zombie variant. Similar to "normal" zombies, these enemies are exclusive to the desert biome, identifiable by their cowboy hats and/or gun belts. They are hot to the touch, and getting hit by them will overheat you briefly.

All "fatties" (Big Mama, tourist etc.) explode …

During bloodmoons, ‘some’ zombies have a 10% chance to respawn after death, unless they’re killed with fire or explosives. There is also a 5% chance that a “boss” zombie will spawn, which boosts all zombies within range; their damage by 20%, and gives them regenerative properties. The boss is marked with a specific symbol, so target them with extreme prejudice.

All “Fat” zombies (Cop,Big Mama and Tourist) are filled with a substance that’s irresistible to all zombies. If you are within range when they explode, they’ll cover you in this stuff - and attract other zombies. Cop and vulture vomit also has this effect.


*** FOOD/FARMING ***

All canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is "uncooked". Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning ...

Uncooked cans don't replenish health, just food and water.

Five new recipes - Chicken stew and chicken miso, top of the tier 3 food chain, along with Scrambled Eggs, a better use for eggs and Tramp/Vagabond stew(s), which use cat/dog food. Basic recipes, unlocked by default. Needs a cooking pot.

MegaCrush is craftable, in a campfire, with a beaker, and cheaper in a chemistry station.

Pies and cheesecake need honey for that sweet, sweet taste now.

Crops' growing time is double that of vanilla.

Farming is reworked entirely. You need a hoe to till the ground to plant seeds. Use the hoe with fertiliser to upgrade the tilled ground. Fertilzed terrain yields 3 crops, same as a farmplot.

Farm Plots require fertiliser and nails to craft, are crafted in the workbench with a hammer,  and are the same fertile level as fertilised ground.

Farmplots found in POI’s are no longer plantable.

There is no harvest bonus for Living off the Land, instead, seeds cost less crops to make per level, and the amount of fertiliser required to make farmplots is reduced per level. Fertiliser is craftable in the cement mixer and chem station, and is in *some* trader stock.

Wild plants can be picked up - press ‘E’ by default to pick them up. Wild plants always give one crop, whether they’re picked up or “punched”.

New plant - lavender. Purple flower found growing in the wild and in some POIs. Seeds crafted from lavender flowers, no unlock required. Lavender flowers can be found in loot and trader stock, and Lavender seeds in trader stock.


*** PROGRESSION ***

There is no more Daring Adventurer or Better Barter. Traders will give a drink after every quest tier, which will increase bartering by 5% and trader level by one for each tier of quests completed. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SPACE IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR IT!!

There is a new perk, Survival Instinct. It's a "single-player" version of Charismatic Nature. 5 levels, each level gains you an additional 5 health/stamina, 10% block damage, 5% entity damage, 3% XP, and carry capacity increases by 1.

Living off the Land now offers a discount to crops needed to make seeds.


*** RESOURCES ***

Trees no longer give wood, they give wood logs, scraps, and branches. Logs can be placed and then chopped with an axe for wood, or use the table saw to do it quicker and better.

Primitive weapons and ammo are now made from wood scraps, branches, plant fibres, and/or stone.

Cobblestone is now more expensive to make in your inventory. Use a cement mixer to make it cheaper.

Concrete now requires a bucket of water and a new material, Feldspar. Concrete is crafted in batches of 250. Returns an empty bucket when crafting is complete. Feldspar can be obtained from Wasteland terrain and surface boulders.

Most ammo can be dismantled into its component parts. Check ammo for recipes, and look at the 3rd tab to see what they dismantle into. Most need a workbench to do this, but basic arrows/bolts can be dismantled in your inventory.

Repair kits are more expensive, and top tier weapons/armour/tools now require a specific repair kit.


*** VEHICLES ***

All vehicles EXCEPT the bicycle are too heavy for you to carry. Crafted vehicles come in a crate for you to carry to their deploy position.

Two new vehicles, the Ruin Runner and The Hornet.
The Ruin Runner is a dirt bike, with similar speed to the motorcycle, but the inventory capacity of the minibike. The Hornet is an off-road dune buggy. As fast as a 4x4, but with the inventory capacity of a motorcycle.

Vehicles CANNOT be used underwater.
