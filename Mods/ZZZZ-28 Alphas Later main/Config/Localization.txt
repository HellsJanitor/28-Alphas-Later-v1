questStartup_offer,"28 Alphas Later"
questStartup_desc,"The idea behind this mod is to slow progression, make traders less powerful, and generally extend the time for a playthrough, while keeping the vanilla look and feel.\n\n[ffd700]GENERAL GAMEPLAY[-]\n\nPlayer starts with a new debuff - Despair.\n\nAs your despair increases, your abilities will be negatively affected. If despair reaches 100%, you'll be seconds from death.\nConversely, if you can manage your despair well, you'll receive buffs for remaining positive.\n\nThe despair indicator on the HUD will fill as your despair grows and will change colour to indicate the level of your despair.\n\nIf you're able to manage your despair and have a more positive outlook, the icon on the HUD will change, as will the fill colour to indicate your levels of positivity.\n\nDespair can also be checked from the player information screen.\n\nHeadshots! Zombies take maximum damage from headshots, however, they do take small damage if you miss the head.\n\nZombies DON'T bleed. Nothing undead takes bleed damage.\n\nHazmat zombies are a guaranteed source of hazmat gear. Kill one, and if it drops loot, it'll have some hazmat gear in there.\n\nThere are more zombies in the world. Biomes are gamestaged, which means zombies get tougher and their numbers increase as you level up.\n\nNights are dangerous, downtown is much more dangerous.\n\nTraders and vending machines are more expensive to buy from, and traders will buy from you at a much lower price.\n\nCrafting is 25% more expensive, and loot, harvesting and scrapping quantities are much lower.\n\nXP required to level is increased by 25%.\n\nDismember chance lowered to 1% per attribute level, max at 10%.\n\nAll blades base damage rebalanced to adjust for damage over time lost from enemies not bleeding."
28AlphasLaterQuest1_title,"Despair"
28AlphasLaterQuest1,"Despair is dynamically affected by various different factors, including:\n\n1. Darkness. Too dark, and your Despair will increase dramatically. Torches, helmet lights and flashlights will mitigate this. Use these in conjunction with a campfire & bedroll for the best effect.\n\n2. Temperature. If you’re freezing or sweltering, your Despair will also increase dramatically. Find shelter!\n\n3. Environment: Varying degrees of wetness will change how Despair affects you, as will your shelter. If you’re warm, dry, sheltered, well lit or resting on a bed or bedroll, AND near an operating campfire ,forge or chem station you can effectively treat Despair.\n\n4. Hunger and thirst affect how quickly your despair increases. Starvation/dehydration will drastically increase the rate at which you become affected by despair.\n\n5. Injuries will affect how quickly your despair increases, so treat them as quickly as you can!\n\n6. There is medication in trader stock and rare medical loot to treat your despair; St. John's Wort treats 10% and Lithium treats 25%.\n\n6a. There is also lavender growing wild, which can be collected to make your own lavender seeds, and is also used to make Lavender Oil in a cooking pot at a campfire. Treats 3% Despair.\n\n7. All food has a positive effect. The better the food, the more effective the treatment.\n\n8. Killing zombies and animals will reduce your overall despair. Conversely, getting hit by enemies will increase it.\n\n9. Being in close proximity to zombies increases your Despair. The tougher the zombie, the worse the effect. The effect is compounded, so the more zombies there are, the worse it'll be.\n\n10. Player wellness. Your maximum health will also slow down the effects of despair. Every 10 additional health slows down the rate at which Despair affects you.\n\n11. The morale booster from the drone will slow down the rate at which despair affects you.\n\n12. The trader has an effect. Being close to a trader will slow down and/or reduce your Despair.\n\n13. The perk From the Shadows also has an effect on the way Despair affects you at NIGHT. The more points in the perk, the less Despair affects you at night."
28AlphasLaterQuest2_title,Enemies
28AlphasLaterQuest2,"Bears and wolves are back in the forest.\n\nHazmat zombies are now immune to burning.\n\nNew Bunker Buster zombie. Only appears during bloodmoon(s), and can appear from the very first Bloodmoon. You’ll want to take it out quickly … think of it as a light demolition zombie.\n\nDemolition zombies appear at a much earlier gamestage.\n\nMutant zombie variant. Top of the food chain these guys. The toughest of all enemies, and will take some stopping. Blessed Metal is your friend ...\n\nMutated zombie variant. Bigger, tankier, stronger, yellower, and with more radiated regen. You'll need a Blessed Metal mod to take them down - the Wasteland biome is full of these guys.\n\nFrozen zombie variant. Slightly tougher, slightly slower, slightly more XP, and take slightly more damage than their Normal counterparts. Immune to the effects of liquid nitrogen, and if they touch you, your movement is reduced by 20%. You can negate this by maxing out the Well Insulated perk.  Found in the snow biome.\n\nRotting zombie variant. They have lower HP, lower XP reward, and they take more damage. Found in the forest biome.\n\nCowboy zombie variant. Similar to normal zombies, these enemies are exclusive to the desert biome, identifiable by their cowboy hats and/or gun belts. They are hot to the touch, and getting hit by them will overheat you briefly.\n\nAll fatties (Big Mama, tourist etc.) explode when their health gets low.\n\nDuring bloodmoons, zombies have a 10% chance to respawn after death, unless they’re killed with fire or explosives. There is also a 5% chance that a boss zombie will spawn, which boosts all zombies damage by 20%. The boss is marked with a specific symbol, so target them with extreme prejudice.\n\nAll Fat zombies (Cop,Big Mama and Tourist) are filled with a substance that’s irresistible to all zombies. If you are within range when they explode, they’ll cover you in this stuff - and attract other zombies. Cop and vulture vomit also has this effect.\n"

It's a single-player version of Charismatic Nature.\n5 levels, each level gains you an additional:\n• 5 health/stamina\n• 10% block damage\n• 5% entity damage\n• 3% Experience gain\n• Carry capacity increases by 1.\n\nLiving off the Land now offers a discount to crops needed to make seeds.\n\nAll tool and weapon skills are now governed exclusively by action skills.\n\nBooks and magazines are now completely random finds in the world.

28AlphasLaterQuest4,"The beehive. Find bees (and honey) in specific beehive stumps in the world, and use them to produce honey. Normal wild tree stumps have a higher chance of giving honey too.\n\nThe rain collector. Works like a dew collector, but requires an empty bucket to collect water.\n\nThe chicken snare Place this block down, and load it with corn seed to attract and trap chickens, which can be used in coops to produce eggs.\n\nThese chickens can also be butchered for meat, feathers and eggs, with a hunting knife in your inventory.\n\nThe chicken coop. Place this block, add a chicken from a snare, and it will produce eggs over time. The chicken will stop producing eggs over time, and will need replacing.\n\nWrench tablesaws for a sawblade - a required component for the sawmill.\n\nThe workbench now has slots for a wrench, hammer, ratchet, impact driver, and nail gun. These tools are needed to craft a lot of items, and some items have been moved from inventory crafting to workbench crafting.\n\nThe cement mixer now requires gasoline to work.\n\nThe blast furnace. Unlocked at level 60 of workstations, the blast furnace is required to turn raw uranium into depleted uranium, and to craft depleted uranium bullet tips.\n\nThe ammo press. Unlocked at level 35 of workstations, the ammo press is required to craft depleted uranium ammunition.\n\nThe sawmill. Unlocked at the same level as the forge, use this workbench to craft wood logs into wood planks. Wrench a tablesaw for a sawblade, or purchase a sawblade from a trader."

28AlphasLaterQuest5,"Snakes and Spider zombies will envenom you when they attack. Kill snakes to extract their venom, which can be used to make antivenom. Antivenom crafting is unlocked after reading 10 medical magazines, and it can appear in loot and trader stock.\n\nThe Wasteland biome is irradiated, and very, VERY dangerous. You'll need hazmat mods before you venture in there.\n\nRadiated zombies now irradiate the player when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.\n\nSome Burnt zombies now set the player on fire when they attack. A full set of hazmat mods negates this.\n\nHoney infection treatment is reduced to 3% from 5%.\n\nDespair medication (Lavender, St. John’s Wort and Lithium) can be found in medical loot, and in trader stock. Lavender oil can be crafted from lavender flowers and used to treat despair."
28AlphasLaterQuest6_title,Food & Farming
28AlphasLaterQuest6,"All canned food found in loot, vending machines, and trader stock is uncooked. Cook it to make it safe to eat, or eat it and run the risk of food poisoning.\n\nUncooked cans don't replenish health, just food and water.\n\nFive new recipes - Chicken stew and chicken miso, top of the tier 3 food chain, along with Scrambled Eggs, a better use for eggs, and Tramp/Vagabond stew(s), which use cat/dog food. Basic recipes, unlocked by default. Needs a cooking pot.\n\nMegaCrush is craftable, in a campfire, with a beaker, and cheaper in a chemistry station.\n\nPies and cheesecake need honey for that sweet, sweet taste now.\n\nCrops growing time is double that of vanilla.\n\nFarming is reworked entirely. You need a hoe to till the ground to plant seeds. Use the hoe with fertiliser in your inventory to upgrade the tilled ground. Fertilized terrain yields 5 crops, same as a farmplot.\n\nFarm Plots require fertiliser and nails to craft, are crafted in the workbench with a hammer,  and are the same fertile level as fertilised ground.\n\nFarmplots found in POI’s are no longer plantable.\n\nThere is no harvest bonus for Living off the Land, instead, seeds cost less crops to make per level, and the amount of fertiliser required to make farmplots is reduced per level. Fertiliser is craftable in the cement mixer and chem station, and is in some trader stock.\n\nAll plants can be picked up - press 'E' by default to pick them up. Wild plants always give one crop, whether they’re picked up or punched.\n\nNew plant - lavender. Purple flower found growing in the Forest biome and in some POIs. Seeds are crafted from lavender flowers, no unlock required. Lavender flowers can be found in loot-] and trader stock, and Lavender seeds in trader stock."
28AlphasLaterQuest7_title,Resources
28AlphasLaterQuest7,"Trees no longer give wood, they give wood logs, scraps, and branches. Logs can be placed and then chopped with an axe for wood, or use the table saw to do it quicker and better.\n\nPrimitive weapons and ammo are now made fromwood scraps, branches, plant fibres, and/or stone.\n\nCobblestone is now more expensive to make in your inventory. Use a cement mixer to make it cheaper.\n\nConcrete now requires a bucket of water and a new material, Feldspar. Concrete is crafted in batches of 250. Returns an empty bucket when crafting is complete.\n\nFeldspar is a vital ingredient in the production of concrete. Find it by mining surface terrain & boulders in the Wasteland biome.\n\nMost ammo can be dismantled into its component parts. Check ammo for recipes, and look at the 3rd tab to see what they dismantle into. Most need a workbench with an ammo press-] to do this, but basic arrows/bolts can be dismantled in your inventory. Loose ammo can also be boxed.\n\nRepair kits are more expensive, and top tier weapons/armour/tools now require a specific repair kit.\n\nRaw uranium. This ore is found exclusively in the wasteland. Take it to a blast furnace to process it into depleted uranium.\n\nPropylene Glycol. This by-product of refining oil shale into gasoline can be used with plant fibre or rotten flesh at a chemistry station to craft scrap polymer."
28AlphasLaterQuest8_title,Vehicles
28AlphasLaterQuest8,"All vehicles EXCEPT the bicycle are too heavy for you to carry. Crafted vehicles come in a crate for you to carry to their deploy position.\n\nTwo new vehicles, the Ruin Runner, and The Hornet.\nThe Ruin Runner is a dirt bike, with similar speed to the motorcycle, but the inventory capacity of the minibike. The Hornet is an off-road dune buggy. As fast as a 4x4, but with the inventory capacity of a motorcycle.\n\nVehicles CANNOT be used underwater."

Shame it doesn't work on the undead.\n\nAmmo can be dismantled into its component parts.\n\nHazmat armour mods can be crafted. You’ll still need all four mods (head, gloves, outfit, and boots) for full radiation protection.\n\nNew mods:\n• Blessed metal for stopping mutated & mutant regen.\n• The NiCd battery - a weapon mod that gives a chance of shocking enemies on hit.\n• The Flaming Oil mod - another weapon mod that gives a chance to set enemies on fire.\n• The Liquid Nitrogen mod - a weapon mod that will freeze & slow enemies briefly when hit.\n\nNew clothing mod - cycling shorts.
